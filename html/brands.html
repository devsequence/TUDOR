						"For some years now, I have been considering the idea of making a watch that our agents could sell at a more modest price than our Rolex watches, and yet one
						that would attain the standard of dependability for which Rolex is famous. I decided to form a separate company, with the object of making and marketing this
						new watch. It is called the TUDOR watch company."
