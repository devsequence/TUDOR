					Geneva for Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf. Later, in 1936, the house transferred the brand to Wilsdorf, Just after the Second World War, Hans
					Wilsdorf knew that the time hac come to expand and give the brand a proper identity ofits own. On 6 March 1946, he created “Montres
					TUDOR S.A.", specialising in models for both men and women. Rolex would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and functional characteristics,

						"For some years now, I have been considering the idea of making a watch that our agents could sell at a more modest price than our Rolex watches, and yet one
						that would attain the standard of dependability for which Rolex is famous. I decided to form a separate company, with the object of making and marketing this
						new watch. It is called the TUDOR watch company."
